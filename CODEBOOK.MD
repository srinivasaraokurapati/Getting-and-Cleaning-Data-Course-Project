Step 1:
________________________________________
•	Pulls all data from the "UCI HAR Dataset" file.
•	Creates "id" column based on initial row number for easier referencing.
•	Merges all of the training data together into mergetrain along with all of the test data together into mergetest.
•	Binds the training data mergetrain and test data mergetest together by row.
Step 2:
________________________________________
•	Selects features which follow the naming criteria specified in specific_features where "mean" and "std" are selected for.
Step 3:
________________________________________
•	Activities, previously denoted numerically, are assigned names at 6 levels which correspond to activities.
Step4:
________________________________________
•	Unnecessary characters in 'specific_features' such as "-" or "()" are removed from feature names.
•	Feature names are added to their corresponding column.
Step 5:
________________________________________
•	Means are found for each variable by subject and activity using aggregate.
•	Tidy dataset outputted as "secTidySet.txt".
